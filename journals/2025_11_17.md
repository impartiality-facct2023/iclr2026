- Section 2
	- Drawer sentences
		- (A) is a problem
		- (B) Parallelism has a problem
		- (C) is fine
	- Transition between the thrusts is unclear
- Section 2.A
	- Dataset Inference is not the strongest
		- Saying it is complementary is no
		- Captures the radiention of changes + retain some signal reagrdless of post-processing
		- No need for watermarking
		- Both proof of learning and DI are better than watermarking => Strawman to critzie
- Canary before suitability filters
	- Suitability filters are not necessary the way to audit
	- Suitability filters are done by the company
		- Nicer way to connect to fairwashing
- Suitabilioty filters can produce models
	- But if there is not scrutny => fairwashing
	- Sutiability filters, there is a less of a incentive
	-
- Q: Do you see the transition between the works?
	- => the follow-up
-
- Dataset inference is being used in industry
	- Legal court case?
	- I was told
	- It has both academic and practical impact (Above) =? goes to impact
		-
- 2.B Intro is too abstract
	- Too long of sentence
	- Why does asymmetry prevents auditing => mention it again (as we just discussed)
-
	- 2.B=>23.C
		- We can make assymmetry be possitive => some potential
		- But does not happen organically => need to create incentives
-
	- PAP => 2.B
	- Another 2.C
	-
	-
- Nicolas Recommendation
	- PAP => framing of regulation
		- PAP and Fariwashing -> it's important to model
			- Otherwise people have incentive to
		- Core advantage to multi-objective ML
	- Isolate the technical problem of multi-objective
	- More suceess on RACO-DP
	- => Auditing
		- ML Regulation
		- LEarning algorithm that
